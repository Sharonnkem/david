I installed and configured traffic monitoring cameras with remote access for diagnostics

To ensure secure access, I implemented authentication and role-based authorization while 
also developing a watchlist system for tracking specific vehicles. I integrated SignalR for 
real-time notifications and built a task management system (Task Bin) for efficient workflow 
organization. Additionally, I developed an email notification system for critical updates and 
user communication. Leading the operations team in the field, I ensured the proper installation 
of sensing layers for efficient data flow.</p>

            <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is Nigeriaâ€™s electoral body responsible for organizing and overseeing elections at the federal, state, and local government levels. It was established in 1998 to conduct free, fair, and credible elections in the country. <br/><br/>
            My work on the Election Result Management System for INEC involved designing and implementing a secure and scalable backend for managing election results efficiently. I developed a secure <strong>OTP login</strong> system for INEC staff, ensuring safe authentication and controlled access. Additionally, I implemented role-based access control for both the admin and mobile applications, ensuring that users only had permissions relevant to their roles. <br/>
            To enhance data retrieval, I built a smart <strong>search</strong> functionality that allows users to find election-related data using <strong>keywords</strong>. I also designed and managed the <strong>database</strong>, handling updates, <strong>migrations</strong>, and optimizations to ensure system integrity.<br/>
            You developed a scheduled email <strong>notification</strong> system using SendGrid, enabling automated alerts for key events. To improve transparency, you implemented an <strong>audit trail</strong> system to log user activities on the admin app, ensuring accountability.</p>
